## Challenges and Solutions
    - The challenge involved designing a clean dashboard to display order, revenue, and inventory charts and tables effectively.

    - Solutions:
        1- To maintain a consistent state across components, I opted for Vuex, a state management library for Vue.js. This allowed seamless communication between components and ensured a single source of truth for the application's state.

        2- Since I used a pure HTML table, implementing sorting and search functionalities required manual effort. Despite the absence of built-in features, this approach provided flexibility and allowed for a customized solution tailored to the project's specific needs.

        3- Data mapping presented a significant challenge. To overcome this, I employed a meticulous approach to ensure accurate mapping between various data sets. This involved creating efficient algorithms and mapping strategies to streamline data presentation on the dashboard.

## Description
    E-commerce managers require a comprehensive understanding of sales, revenue, and 
    inventory status for effective decision-making. The objective of this task is to develop a 
    web-based admin dashboard that centralizes all these crucial data points. The final submission 
    should include both the source code and a link to the hosted page demonstrating the working 
    dashboard.
